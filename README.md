NotesApp
========

Perhaps more than any other application to date, I've used and polished the NotesApp project quite thoroughly. I use it every day to manage my schoolwork as well as client and personal projects. It doesn't have the robust synchronization of Evernote or Dropbox, so I recommend backing up your database tables to an external server on a weekly basis.

After cloning this repository, you still need to do two things in order to fully configure your instance of this application:

1. Retrieve the [config class](https://github.com/martynchamberlin/ConfigClass) and plug in your database credentials.
2. Import the SQL file located inside this repository's `SQL` directory.
